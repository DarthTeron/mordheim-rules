    Dark Elf Leaders are typically drawn from the Dark Elf nobility and lead the warband in search of gold,
    slaves and arcane artefacts to bring home to Naggaroth. They are cold and ruthless killers and they command
    the respect of their troops through assassination and terror. They have attained their position of leadership
    by eliminating rival nobles who stand in their way and through their remarkable cunning, they are dangerous
    foes who embody the merciless traits of the Druchii race.
