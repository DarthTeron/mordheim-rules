      <description>DifficultyName9+1 - DoomboltThe bolt of doom may be targeted at any enemy model in line of sight. The Doombolt has an 18&amp;quot; range and causes a Strength 5 hit. If the target model is wounded, then the next closest model within 3&amp;quot; is also hit on a 4+, at -1 Strength than the previous hit. The bolt will keep leaping until there are no more targets within range or until its Strength drops to a one.</description>

      <description>Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High Elvesâ€™ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves.</description>
