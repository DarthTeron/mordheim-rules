The Dark Elves are as accomplished practitioners of magic as their arch enemies the High Elves but whereas the High Elves essentially use magic defensively and for the power of good, the Dark Elves utilise the evil powers of Dark Magic a very destructive force indeed.

{{< spell name="Doombolt" difficulty=9 >}}
*Whispering an ancient incantation the Sorceress conjures a bolt of pure dark energy and unleashes it from her outstretched hand.*
The bolt of doom may be targeted at any enemy model in line of sight. The Doombolt has an 18" range and causes a Strength 4 hit. If the target model is wounded, then the next closest model within 3" is also hit on a 4+, at -1 Strength than the previous hit. The bolt will keep leaping until there are no more targets within range or until its Strength drops to a one. Each model can only be hit by a bolt once per turn. Take armour saves as normal.
