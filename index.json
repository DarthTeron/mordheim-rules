The Doombolt has an 18\u0026quot; range and causes a Strength 5 hit. If the target model is wounded, then the next closest model within 3\u0026quot; is also hit on a 4+, at -1 Strength than the previous hit. The bolt will keep leaping until there are no more targets within range or until its Strength drops to a one. Each model can only be hit by a bolt once per turn. Take armour saves as normal.\n\r\r\r8+\r2 - Word of Pain\r\r\r\r\rThe spell may be cast at an enemy model within 12\u0026quot;. The victim suffers -1WS, -1BS, -1S and must take a leadership test to charge or shoot. Lasts until the beginning of the next Dark Elf turn.\n\r\r\r9+\r3 - Soul Stealer\r\r\r\r\rThis spell causes one close combat attack in the magic phase. This hits normally and causes an automatic wound. Defenses against hits may be taken, defenses against wounds are ignored except ward saves or specifically against magic. She may add an extra temporary wound to her profile, exceeding her max wounds by a maximum of 1.\n\r\r\r9+\r4 - Flamesword\r\r\r\r\rThe Sorceress may choose the hand-to-hand combat weapon of a member of her warband within 6\u0026quot; to be engulfed in flames. A weapon with these flames acts as a normal weapon of its type, but also adds a +2 bonus to the users Strength. Lasts until the Sorceress’ next shooting phase.\n\r\r\r10+\r5 - Deathspasm\r\r\r\r\rThe Deathspasm has a range of 6\u0026quot; and must be cast on the closest enemy model. The affected model must roll on the injury chart. If successfully cast, the casting Sorceress is immediately knocked down.\n\r\r\r7+\r6 - Witch Flight\r\r\r\r\rThe Sorceress may immediately move anywhere within 12\u0026quot;, and may count as charging.

	"content": "Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High Elves’ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves. The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark God, or tortured mercilessly by the Brides of Khaine, the Witch Elves. Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.\nDespite their dire reputation for cruelty they are only rivalled as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It is the lure of the precious, arcane artefacts of the Slann that bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen – most warbands don’t even know they’re being attacked until it is too late.\nSpecial Rules  Kindred Hatred The Dark Elves have been fighting the High Elves for many centuries. The wars between these two races have been very long and bloody affairs. Dark Elves Hate any High Elf warriors including High Elf Hired Swords. Excellent Sight There are numerous legends detailing the excellent eyesight of the Elves, both Druchii and Ulthuan kin. Elves can spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away than normal warriors. (i.e. twice their Initiative value in inches) Black Powder Weapons Dark Elves may never use black powder weapons as they find them too crude, noisy and unreliable. Alignment the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.  Choice of Warriors A Dark Elf warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never exceed 12.\n High Born: Each Dark Elf warband must have one High Born to lead it – no more, no less. Beastmaster: Your warband may include one Beastmaster. Fellblades: Your warband may include up to two Fellblades. Sorceress: Your warband may include one Sorceress. Corsairs: Your warband may include any number of Corsairs. Shades: Your warband may include up to five Shades. Cold One Hounds: Your warband may include up to two hounds if it also includes a Beastmaster.  Beastmaster 50 Gold Crowns to hire Whereas the High Elves have a great affinity with Dragons and Griffons and other noble creatures their malevolent kin have infamous Beastmasters, Dark Elves of particularly cruel renown who breed many vicious beasts and lead them into contact. Unlike the High Elves who treat their beasts as companions, the Dark Elf Beastmasters are very spiteful masters.\nStats for Beastmaster  MWSBSSTWIALd   544331618   Special RulesCold One Beasthound: The Beastmaster may be accompanied by up to two Cold One Beasthounds, these are bought as henchmen and follow all rules for listed for them.\nSkill access: CombatSpeedDark Elf Special Skill  Fellblade 50 Gold Crowns to hire The Fellblades are elite warriors of the Dark Elf armies and are often linked to the household of a particular Noble family. Fellblades live a life of strict martial training, each specialises in a particular weapon and fighting style. Killing is a way of life for these warriors. Enemies can expect no mercy from them. Fellblades accompany raiding parties to Lustria as paid guards or to further hone their killing skills.\nStats for Fellblade  MWSBSSTWIALd   554331618   Special RulesMelee Specialist: Fellblades live by a strict code of close quarter fighting. Fellblades may not use missile warpons of any sort.\nSkill access: CombatSpeedDark Elf Special Skill  High Born 80 Gold Crowns to hire Dark Elf Leaders are typically drawn from the Dark Elf nobility and lead the warband in search of gold, slaves and arcane artefacts to bring home to Naggaroth. They are cold and ruthless killers and they command the respect of their troops through assassination and terror. They have attained their position of leadership by eliminating rival nobles who stand in their way and through their remarkable cunning, they are dangerous foes who embody the merciless traits of the Druchii race.\nStats for High Born  MWSBSSTWIALd   554331619   Special RulesLeader: Any models in the warband within 6\u0026quot; of the High Born may use his Leadership instead of their own.\nSkill access: CombatShootingAcademicSpeedDark Elf Special Skill  Sorceress 70 Gold Crowns to hire Dark Elves are strange in that apart from the fell Witch King there are no other male sorcerers, all the other practitioners of magic in the Dark Elf race are female. It is rumoured that any males who do develop an affinity for magic amongst the Dark Elves are immediately put to death to fulfil some dark prophecy. Dark Elf Sorceresses are mysterious, raven haired beauties who are grudgingly respected even from the powerful High Born and their services are high in demand.\nStats for Sorceress  MWSBSSTWIALd   544331618   Special RulesMagic User: The Dark Elf Sorceress has the ability to use magic and casts spells like any other magicians, and the Dark Elf Sorceress starts with one spells generated at random from the Dark Elf Magic list. See the Magic section for details. In addition the Dark Elf Sorceress may learn a new Spell instead on a new skill.\nSkill access: AcademicSpeedDark Elf Special Skill   Equipment The following lists are used by Dark Elf warbands to pick their weapons:\nDark Elf Equipment List    Hand-to-hand Combat Weapons      Dagger 1st free/2 GC   Axe 5 GC   Sword 10 GC   Double-handed weapon 15 GC   Halberd 10 GC   Spear 10 GC   Beastlash 10 GC   Dark Steel Weapon* 2x price    \r   Missile Weapons      Repeater Crossbow 35 GC   Crossbow Pistol 35 GC    \r   Armour      Buckler 5 GC   Shield 5 GC   Helmet 10 GC   Light armour 20 GC   Dark Steel Armour* 95 GC    \r   Special Equipment      Dark Venom* 15 GC   Sea Dragon Cloak** 50 GC    Shades Equipment List    Hand-to-hand Combat Weapons      Dagger 1st free/2 GC   Axe 5 GC   Sword 10 GC       Missile Weapons      Repeater Crossbow 35 GC       Armour      Helmet 10 GC   Light armour 20 GC    *: May be taken by Heroes only.\n**: May be taken by Heroes and Corsairs only.\nDark Elf Magic \rThe Dark Elves are as accomplished practitioners of magic as their arch enemies the High Elves but whereas the High Elves essentially use magic defensively and for the power of good, the Dark Elves utilise the evil powers of Dark Magic a very destructive force indeed.\r\rDifficulty\rName\r\r\r\r9+\r1 - Doombolt\r\r\r\r\rWhispering an ancient incantation the Sorceress conjures a bolt of pure dark energy and unleashes it from her outstretched hand.\nThe bolt of doom may be targeted at any enemy model in line of sight. The Doombolt has an 18\u0026quot; range and causes a Strength 5 hit. If the target model is wounded, then the next closest model within 3\u0026quot; is also hit on a 4+, at -1 Strength than the previous hit. The bolt will keep leaping until there are no more targets within range or until its Strength drops to a one. Each model can only be hit by a bolt once per turn. Take armour saves as normal.\n\r\r\r8+\r2 - Word of Pain\r\r\r\r\rThe Sorceress calls the curse of the Witch King down on his enemy reducing their willingness to fight.\nThe spell may be cast at an enemy model within 12\u0026quot;. The victim suffers -1WS, -1BS, -1S and must take a leadership test to charge or shoot. Lasts until the beginning of the next Dark Elf turn.\n\r\r\r9+\r3 - Soul Stealer\r\r\r\r\rAt the Sorceress’s touch, the essence of life is drained from her enemy and absorbed into her body giving him renewed strength and vigour.\nThis spell causes one close combat attack in the magic phase. This hits normally and causes an automatic wound. Defenses against hits may be taken, defenses against wounds are ignored except ward saves or specifically against magic. She may add an extra temporary wound to her profile, exceeding her max wounds by a maximum of 1.\n\r\r\r9+\r4 - Flamesword\r\r\r\r\rSummoning Dark Magic the Sorceress engulfs a weapon in twisted black flames.\nThe Sorceress may choose the hand-to-hand combat weapon of a member of her warband within 6\u0026quot; to be engulfed in flames. A weapon with these flames acts as a normal weapon of its type, but also adds a +2 bonus to the users Strength. Lasts until the Sorceress’ next shooting phase.\n\r\r\r10+\r5 - Deathspasm\r\r\r\r\rThe Sorceress channels Dark Magic into her enemy, causing him to writhe in excruciating pain.\nThe Deathspasm has a range of 6\u0026quot; and must be cast on the closest enemy model. The affected model must roll on the injury chart. If successfully cast, the casting Sorceress is immediately knocked down.\n\r\r\r7+\r6 - Witch Flight\r\r\r\r\rThe Sorceress bends the winds of magic to her will and flies through the air.\nThe Sorceress may immediately move anywhere within 12\u0026quot;, and may count as charging.
